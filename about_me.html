			<p>My name is Rose and in the photo above next to me is my boyfriend, Connor.
			<br/>He has been such a supportive person in my life on this journey to a healthier life style. I don't think 
			<br/>I could continues to strive without his stream of encouragement. I am a student at a university majoring in 
			<br/> marketing and English with a concentration in Creative Writing and a minor in New Media. Thank you for 
			<br/>tuning in and following along on my adventure to a healthier life style.</p>
